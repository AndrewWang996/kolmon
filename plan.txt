Issues:
leaving the room after moving around a lot (queuing a lot of method calls) causes a significant delay as the server tries to catch up 

some ideas for optimizing performance:
- throttle update loop (lower fps, less db writes, etc)
- use webgl instead of canvas (significantly faster)
- move the game related stuff to separate collection. a potential source of the problem could be that everytime the user's position is updated, the entire user object has to be validated agains the db schema (including irrelevant things like username, email, killCount, etc), so separating player and user might have been a good idea after all. 
- not sure if this will improve performance, but what if we just have the room document hold an array of all the positions of the players inside the room? instead of fetching all the users, fetching a single room document & iterating over the array locally might be faster
